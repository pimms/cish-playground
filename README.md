# Cish Playground

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Cish requires Antlr to generate the syntax files.

``
$ brew install antlr
```

### Cish Submodule Initialization

Run `setup.sh` to ensure Xcode project files for Cish and the Antlr runtime is
created:

```
$ ./setup.sh
```

Compile & run `cpg.xcodeproj`, and you should be good to go!
